# PlayLimit

PlayLimit is a simple WoW addon for the 2.4.3 game client. It  doesn't have a UI - but it limits playtime to 6 hours per week. After those hours are up, the addon will start to kick you out of the game every minute. 

I no longer play WoW. This was just a simple project I built for myself for fun (to try WoW addon creation on one boring weekend).
